        I'm a youngster in the world of Programming. I try to play around with code, and slowly getting to a solution. I like searching and scrumbling around internet. I have gathered experience in Html, Css, Javascript, Java, Asp.net and Php. I used frameworks like: Bootstrap, React, Laravel, Asp.net MVC. I describe myself as a quick learner and love to work on group and collaborate with other team members, as one old saying is "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go on group". I try to bring change in the world of programming one line of code at a time, so let's work together and bring new ideas and change to life!
      </motion.p>

      <div className='mt-20 flex flex-wrap gap-10'>
        {services.map((service, index) => (
          <ServiceCard key={service.title} index={index} {...service} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default SectionWrapper(About, "about");
